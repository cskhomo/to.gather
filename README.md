# To Gather

2D puzzle-platformer game built with the Godot Engine, where you play as Ant Prime, the first servant of the queen. In this game, your journey begins as a lone explorer, gathering resources to sustain the queen and fuel the growth of the colony. As the colony expands, your role evolves from gathering to guiding, shaping the world to enable the colony to thrive collectively.

## Overview

At the start, Ant Prime navigates a challenging world alone, moving objects, overcoming obstacles, and collecting resources to support the queen. As the queen consumes resources and produces new ants, the colony grows, reflected by rising numbers on the HUD. With this growth, Prime’s role shifts from solitary gatherer to a leader who carves paths for the colony to harvest resources together.

**To Gather** is a story of purpose, responsibility, and the power of collective effort.
